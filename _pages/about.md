# About me

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia"> I am <b>Khan Md Hasib</b>, currently on pursuing my PhD at The University of Western Australia. I'm also an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT). I hold an MSc in Computer Science from BRAC University and a BSc from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. My research primarily focuses on machine learning, deep learning, and AI applications in health, social networks, and robotics. I have several publications in reputable journals and have received awards for my research contributions, including two best paper awards.</p>
